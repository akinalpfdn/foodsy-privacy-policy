  <h1>Foodsy – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="muted">Effective date: 10 Aug 2025 (UTC)</div>

  <p>Foodsy is a recipe sharing application. We collect and use only the minimum data necessary to provide sign‑in and core app functionality.</p>

  <h2>Data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google account basic info</strong> (email address) via Google Sign‑In / Firebase Authentication, to create and manage your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Foodsy user ID</strong> created by Firebase Authentication.</li>
    <li><strong>User‑generated content</strong> you choose to upload (e.g., recipe titles, photos, ingredients, and instructions). This content is stored in our Firebase project.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do not sell your data. We do not request sensitive permissions (location, contacts, SMS, etc.).</p>

  <h2>How we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate you and keep you signed in.</li>
    <li>Display your recipes within the app.</li>
    <li>Maintain the security and integrity of our services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data sharing</h2>
  <p>We share data only with service providers we use to operate Foodsy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Authentication, Firestore/Storage) – account management and content hosting. See Google’s privacy policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data retention & deletion</h2>
  <p>Your account data and uploaded content are retained for as long as your account remains active. You can request deletion of your account and data at any time by contacting us (see Contact). Deleting your account removes your authentication record and attempts to remove your content from our database and storage.</p>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>Foodsy is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Data is transmitted over HTTPS and stored in Firebase. While we follow industry practices, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or requests (including data deletion), contact us at: <strong>akinalpfdn@example.com</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above when changes are made.</p>
